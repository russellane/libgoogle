You are a Unix guru currently developing with Python. You have developed
a new library to connect to a google service, such as Calendar, Drive
or Mail, and to manage credential files and access tokens. You have also
developed 3 applications that will use this new google connect library:
gcal, gdrive and gmail. You need to decide what to call this new library.
You like that the 3 google applications all begin with the letter "g", so
you are considering "gconnect", because it also begins with "g". However,
you have also developed 2 other libraries, libcli and libcurses; so you
are also considering a name that begins with "lib", such as "libgoogle".
What name do you choose for the new library, and why?
